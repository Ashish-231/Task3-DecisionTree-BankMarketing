# Task 3 – Decision Tree Classifier 🌳📊

As part of my **Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology**, I built a **Decision Tree Classifier** using the **Bank Marketing Dataset** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

## 🔹 Steps Performed
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables  
- Splitting dataset into training & testing sets  
- Training a Decision Tree Classifier (Entropy criterion)  
- Evaluating the model with Accuracy, Confusion Matrix & Classification Report  
- Visualizing the Decision Tree for interpretability  

## 🔹 Key Insights
- Decision Tree models provide **transparent & interpretable** predictions.  
- Features like `duration`, `campaign`, and `pdays` had strong influence on outcomes.  
- Model achieved good accuracy with clear class separation.  

## 🔹 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## 🔹 Files
- ![Task3_DecisionTree_BankMarketing](TASK_3.ipynb) → Jupyter Notebook with code & outputs  
- ![Bank Dataset](bank.csv) → Bank Marketing dataset (UCI Repository)
